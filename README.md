# PyDS


What is a DS?
A data structure is a data organization, management, and storage format that enables efficient access and modification. More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data.

What is ADT?

Data type


##### Primitive data types - Integers, Chars, Boolean, Float, Byte, Long, Double
##### 


### Linear DS


Data structure where data elements are arranged sequentially or linearly where the elements are attached to its previous and next adjacent in what is called a linear data structure. In linear data structure, single level is involved. Therefore, we can traverse all the elements in single run only. Linear data structures are easy to implement because computer memory is arranged in a linear way. Its examples are array, stack, queue, linked list, etc.

- Array
- Stack
- Queue
- LinkedList

### Non-Linear DS

Data structures where data elements are not arranged sequentially or linearly are called non-linear data structures. In a non-linear data structure, single level is not involved. Therefore, we canâ€™t traverse all the elements in single run only. Non-linear data structures are not easy to implement in comparison to linear data structure. It utilizes computer memory efficiently in comparison to a linear data structure. Its examples are trees and graphs.

- Graphs
- Trees
- Tries



## Complexity Analysis
#### Big Oh
Worst case analysis where limit n -> infinity.
f(n) >= c*g(n) for n>n0 & n0 > 1 & c>0  where g(n) = n
f(n) = O(c* g(n))
#### Big Omega
Best case analysis where 
f(n) <= c*g(n) for n>n0 & n0 > 1 & c>0  where g(n) = n
then f(n)= Theta(c * g(n))
#### Big Theta
Average case analysis where 
c1 *g(n) <=f(n) <= c2 *g(n) for n>n0 & n0 > 1 & c1 & c2 >0  where g(n) = n
