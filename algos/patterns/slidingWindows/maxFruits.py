# Given an array of characters where each character represents a fruit tree, 
# you are given two baskets and your goal is to put maximum number of fruits in each basket. 
# The only restriction is that each basket can have only one type of fruit.

# You can start with any tree, but once you have started you canâ€™t skip a tree. 
# You will pick one fruit from each tree until you cannot, i.e., 
# you will stop when you have to pick from a third fruit type.

# Write a function to return the maximum number of fruits in both the baskets.

'''
Input: Fruit=['A', 'B', 'C', 'A', 'C']
Output: 3
Explanation: We can put 2 'C' in one basket and one 'A' in the other from the subarray ['C', 'A', 'C']

Input: Fruit=['A', 'B', 'C', 'B', 'B', 'C']
Output: 5
Explanation: We can put 3 'B' in one basket and two 'C' in the other basket. 
This can be done if we start with the second letter: ['B', 'C', 'B', 'B', 'C']
