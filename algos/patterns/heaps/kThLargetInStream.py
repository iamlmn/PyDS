# # Kth Largest Number in a Stream

# Problem Statement #
# Design a class to efficiently find the Kth largest element in a stream of numbers.

# The class should have the following two things:

# The constructor of the class should accept an integer array containing initial numbers from the stream and an integer â€˜Kâ€™.
# The class should expose a function add(int num) which will store the given number and return the Kth largest number.
# Example 1:

# Input: [3, 1, 5, 12, 2, 11], K = 4
# 1. Calling add(6) should return '5'.
# 2. Calling add(13) should return '6'.
# 2. Calling add(4) should still return '6'.
